        <h3>First Date ❤️</h3>
        <p>That day was magic. I still remember the way you smiled when we first met, how we talked for some time while walking on the streets of Anchor and lost track of time. Every moment felt special, and I knew from that night that something wonderful was beginning. Thank you for making our first date unforgettable.</p>

        <h3>Valentine Surprise 🎉</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted to make our first Valentine’s Day together extra special, so I planned a little surprise for you. Seeing your face light up when you found the notes and gifts I left made my heart so happy. Sharing that day with you, laughing and enjoying every moment, reminded me how lucky I am to have you in my life. Thank you for making every celebration brighter and for being

          <h3>Why I Love You 💖</h3>
          <p>
              I love you for so many reasons, but most of all because you are my best friend, my confidant, and my greatest supporter. You make me laugh when I need it most, comfort me when I’m down, and celebrate every little victory with me. Your kindness, patience, and understanding inspire me every day. I love the way you listen, the way you care, and the way you always know how to make things better. Thank you for loving me as I am and for making every day brighter just by being you. I am so grateful for you, and I love you more than words can say.

    <h3>Rainy Day  Date 🌧️</h3>
    <p>That evening, as the rain began to fall and we found ourselves eating boiled groudnut 🤣 at our favorite spot near the woman selling roasted yam, our clothes got soaked while we sat together while i was massaging you 😉 yeah but our hearts felt warm. It’s strange how the world can feel so quiet and peaceful in the rain, especially when I’m walking beside you.</p>

    <h3>Our First Trip 🚐</h3>
    <p>Our first day away from school together felt like a dream. Every photo, every laugh, every little fun  we had before we left that prison we call 'school', turned into a memory I really cherish. Traveling with you made me realize that no matter where we are, if we’re together, it’s home.</p>

    <h3>The Midnight Call 📞</h3>
    <p>It was late, and the world was asleep, but we stayed up talking for hours. I remember lying in bed, smiling at your voice through the phone, wishing that moment could last forever. That call reminded me how deeply connected we are, even apart...</p>

    <h3>Your Birthday 🎂</h3>
    <p>Planning your birthday was almost as exciting as the day itself. Seeing your eyes sparkle when you saw the website, the decorations, the dramatic display, and all the little details made my heart full. That day wasn’t just a celebration of you — it was a celebration of us. Duhhhhhh! 🙄</p>

    <h3>Movie Night 🍿</h3>
    <p>We didn’t need anything fancy — just video calling, enough data, and the K-Drama (What's wrong with secretary Kim?) 🤣🤣. Somewhere between the laughter, the funny comments, and the moments of comfortable silence, I realized those quiet nights with you are my favorite kind of magic.</p>

    <h3>The Day You Said Yes 💍</h3>
    <p>I’ll never forget the look in your eyes when you said “yes.” It wasn’t just an answer — it was a promise, a new chapter, and the beginning of the rest of our lives. That moment is etched in my heart forever and forever 💕</p>

    <h3>The day i fell sick 😷</h3>
    <p>That evening we stayed outside, no pressure, no rush — just us. You turned into my mother and my personal nurse, bribing me with a peck and threatening to call my mom if I didn’t take my meds. Honestly, I think you enjoyed bossing me around a little too much!😏 Well...it reminded me that love isn’t always about grand gestures, but sometimes about making sure your stubborn babyy takes care of himself (and maybe laughing at their grumpy face).</p>

    <h3>Student Week Adventures</h3>
    <p>We literally spent the whole day together — from going to the field, to the ATM to withdraw sweet cash, to going shopping, then to the faculty...😏. I love the way you leaned into me, and I realized no view could ever be more beautiful than having you right there beside me. Walking with you throughout that day was a flex; I had my girlfriend attached to me, and me only.</p>

    <h3>The Inside Joke 😂</h3>
    <p>It’s funny how just one word or a glance between us can send us both into fits of laughter. Those little inside jokes are proof that we share a world that only belongs to us.</p>

    <h3>Longest Video Call 💃</h3>
<p>
  Our longest video call wasn’t about talking nonstop — it was about being together, even in silence.  
  We were both studying for our exams, but neither of us wanted to hang up.  
  For 4 hours, 8 minutes, and 0 seconds straight, we stayed connected — sharing glances, little smiles, and the comfort of knowing the other was there.  
  It might have been quiet, but it was one of the most beautiful moments we’ve shared.

    <h3>The Handwritten Letter ✉️</h3>
    <p>The day you gave me that letter, I read it over and over. Every word felt like a hug from your heart. In a world full of instant messages, your handwriting made it all the more special. Thank youuuu ❤</p>
